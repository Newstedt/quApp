This is a simple application which can be used to analyse US Treasury Bonds.

## Description

The application uses information from:

- Nasdaq Data Link: US Treasury Yield Curves
- Treasurydirect: Reference data for US Treasury Bonds

It then has the ability to calculate a theoretical price/discounted fair value of bonds, given CUSIP as an input. As a sub-product of that, it can also provide a cashflow matrix (with discounted cashflows and discount factors) assuming continous discounting, as well as historical movements in the US Treasury Yield (tenor-by-tenor). Additionally, a simple web application can be launched to showcase some of the capabilities of the code.

## Comming
